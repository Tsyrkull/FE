00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Disturbed - The Sound Of Silence

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Hello, darkness, my old friend

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I've come to talk with you again

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Because a vision softly creeping

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And the vision that was planted in my brain

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Still remains

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Within the sound of silence

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In restless dreams I walked alone

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Narrow streets of cobblestone

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Neath the halo of a street lamp

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That split the night

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And touched the sound of silence

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And in the naked light I saw

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Ten thousand people, maybe more

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
People talking without speaking

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
People hearing without listening

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
People writing songs that voices never share

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And no one dare

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Disturb the sound of silence

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"Fools," said I, "You do not know

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Silence, like a cancer, grows

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Hear my words that I might teach you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Take my arms that I might reach you"

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But my words like silent raindrops fell

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And echoed in the wells of silence

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And the people bowed and prayed

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
To the neon god they made

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And the sign flashed out its warning

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
In the words that it was forming

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And the sign said:
"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And tenement halls

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And whispered in the sound

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Of silence"
